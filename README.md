# ML-Kaggle-Titanic-Data
Application of various Machine Learning Algorithms and Optimization techniques to make Prediction on the Titanic Dataset at Kaggle.com

This is a very small dataset and the accuracy can hardly be increased from here on substantially.

This was mainly done in order to gain familiarity with pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn and Keras.

## Installation
Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook Installed

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notebooks

 - Titanic.ipynb : Contains the details Machine Learning Analysis of the dataset
 - Feature Extraction.ipynb :Contains experimental code to get familiar with various feature extraction techniques

Hope this serves as a Cheat Sheet for basic Scikit-Learn,pandas and matplotlib functions.
